# Chrome Extension: Tab Title Display - Code Explanation

## Introduction (30 seconds)
Hello! Today, I'm going to walk you through a simple Chrome extension that displays the title of the current tab when a button is clicked. This extension demonstrates basic interaction with Chrome's tabs API and DOM manipulation.

## Manifest File (1 minute)
Let's start with the manifest.json file:
- This file is crucial for any Chrome extension.
- It's in JSON format and defines the extension's properties and permissions.
- Key points:
  - We're using Manifest V3, the latest version.
  - We define a popup action, which creates a button in the Chrome toolbar.
  - We request the "activeTab" permission to access the current tab's information.
- We specify icons for various sizes, which appear in different contexts in Chrome.

## HTML Structure (1 minute)
Next, let's look at our popup.html:
- This is a simple HTML file that defines the structure of our popup.
- It contains:
  - A button to trigger the title fetch.
  - A div to display the fetched title.
  - Links to our CSS and JavaScript files.
- We've kept it minimal to focus on functionality.

## CSS Styling (1 minute)
Our styles.css file:
- Uses CSS variables for a consistent color scheme.
- Styles the body, button, and title display area.
- Gives a modern, clean look inspired by the shadcn UI design system.
- Includes hover effects and rounded corners for a polished feel.

## JavaScript Functionality (1.5 minutes)
Finally, the popup.js file:
- This is where the main logic of our extension lives.
- Key points:
  - We use an event listener to detect when the button is clicked.
  - When clicked, we use chrome.tabs.query to get information about the active tab.
  - We extract the title from the tab information.
  - We update the DOM to display this title in our popup.
- This demonstrates how to interact with Chrome's extension APIs and manipulate the DOM.

## Conclusion (30 seconds)
And that's our extension! To recap:
- We used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a simple but functional Chrome extension.
- It demonstrates key concepts like Chrome's manifest structure, permissions, and tab interactions.
- This serves as a great starting point for more complex extensions.
